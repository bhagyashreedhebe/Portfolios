Portfolio 1:

Analysis of CSV data for cycling strava and cheetah. Used inner join to join the two dataframes for which output will contain columns present in strava only.
Removed the rides with no measured power and with Nan vales
Used subplot to plot multiple graphs at a time.
Skew() : In-built function we get the skewness of the data over a requested axis wherein a value closer to 0 represents a normal distribution
Heatmap : A rectangular color encoded matrix which shows the correlation between variables on a scale of 1 to -1.
Made use of differnt plotting techniques e.g. scatter plot, distplot, bar plot for data visualisation.
